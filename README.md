Computer Systems Security Group Project

Date:Febuary 1st - April 27th

Team Members: Candan(Leader), Daniel, Devon

Description:

The purpose of this project is to test the efficiency of detecting vulnerabilities using OpenVAS, 
Nessus, and Metasploit. We used 3 different operating systems Metasploitable, Fedora, and CentOS 
to test the efficiency of our vulnerability assessment tools. We used Metasploitable for its numerable 
vulnerabilities as our baseline least secure system. We used Fedora because it is used to host servers
so we wanted to see how secure the system would be. We used CentOS because it is widely used by scientists, 
so we wanted to compare its security to Fedora and Metasploitable. Candan will be using Nessus, 
Devon will be using OpenVAS, and Daniel will be using Metasploit.
